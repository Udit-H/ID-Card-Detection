# Smart Lab Access & Occupancy System

This project is a **smart lab entry management system** that combines **YOLOv8-based ID card detection**, **Arduino sensors**, and a **Flask web interface**. It automatically detects ID cards, tracks real-time lab occupancy, and enforces a maximum occupancy limit to ensure safety.

## ✨ Features
- YOLOv8-powered ID card detection using OpenCV  
- Arduino integration for entry/exit tracking  
- Flask-based web dashboard for monitoring occupancy  
- Configurable maximum occupancy limit (default: 50)  
- Automatic snapshot saving of detected ID cards  
- Real-time occupancy logging
